## Hi, I'm Jakob NystrÃ¶m ðŸ‘‹

I work as Principal (senior project manager) at [BCG X](https://www.bcg.com/x), leading teams that build and deploy custom data & AI products for clients. I'm currently on leave of absence and pursuing a [Master's in Data Science](https://www.uu.se/en/study/programme/masters-programme-data-science-machine-learning-and-statistics) at Uppsala University.

This private GitHub contains a collection of small scripts / notebooks and larger projects that I've been working on, as part of course work or in my free time.
